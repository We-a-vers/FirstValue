# Naming Conventions

## Context and Problem Statement

Inconsistent branch, file, and variable names can affect the readability of code. In order to keep our code organized and allow every member to understand others' code easily, we will follow a standard naming convention for files/components, variables, and branches.

## Considered Options

* Following naming conventions used commonly in React
* Following workplace naming conventions

## Decision Outcome

- Naming convention for branches
  - ‘fvt’ followed by issue # followed by issue name
  - Ex. fvt-5-home-header
