# React Project Setup Guide with Vite

This README file provides instructions on how to set up and start a React project using Vite. Please follow these steps to get your React application up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Vite requires Node.js to run, and it comes with npm (Node Package Manager). You can download and install Node.js from their official website.

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up and start your React project with Vite:

1. **Create a New Project**: Open your terminal and run the following command to create a new React project using Vite. Replace `<project-name>` with the desired name for your project:

    ```shell
    cd <project-name>
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Vite will automatically generate a `package.json` file with the necessary dependencies. To install these dependencies, run the following command:

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

3. **Development Mode**: To start your project in development mode, run the following command:

    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```

   This command will build your React app and start a development server. You can access your app in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The app will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source code.


## Additional Information

- **Folder Structure**: Vite generates a project structure optimized for development. You can organize your source code in the `src` directory and use the `public` directory for static assets.

- **Configuration**: Vite simplifies configuration but still allows you to configure your project in a `vite.config.js` file if needed.

- **Custom Scripts**: You can define custom npm scripts in the `package.json` file for various tasks specific to your project.

Now, your React project with Vite is set up and ready to go! You can start building your application by adding components, styles, and functionality. Happy coding!
